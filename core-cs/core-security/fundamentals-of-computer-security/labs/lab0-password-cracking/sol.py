Password is lowercase letters a-z.

You don't know the length upfront 
(maybe try from 1 up to a reasonable max, like 8 or 10, depending on expected difficulty).

Hash is truncated SHA256 (48 bits â†’ 12 hex digits).

So the search space is exactly what you thought: 26^L for a word of length L.

1 hex = 4 bits
