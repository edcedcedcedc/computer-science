    I am using chatgpt as my TA, like office hours in US unis, gpt is my feedback, I he hints explains, I think etc.

A) Typically, only the root user on a machine has access to the shadow file. 
The shadow file only contains passwords hashes â€“ not the passwords themselves. 
In one sentence, explain why it is important to protect the hashed passwords ?

response:
Because an attack might crack the hash thru brute force as an example 

B)
Look online for information about the shadow file format. 
Why does the format allow the password hashes for each user to be hashed with a different hash function?

response:
Because the password algorithms might be upgraded with stronger ones over time
