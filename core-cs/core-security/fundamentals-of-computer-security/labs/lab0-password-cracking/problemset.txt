lab0 reading - https://61600-labs.csail.mit.edu/lab0.html

NOTE:
    I am using chatgpt as my TA, like office hours in US unis, gpt is my feedback, I he hints explains, I think etc.

A) Typically, only the root user on a machine has access to the shadow file. 
The shadow file only contains passwords hashes â€“ not the passwords themselves. 
In one sentence, explain why it is important to protect the hashed passwords ?

response:
Because an attack might crack the hash thru brute force as an example 

B)
Look online for information about the shadow file format. 
Why does the format allow the password hashes for each user to be hashed with a different hash function?

response:
Because the password algorithms might be upgraded with stronger ones over time 


readind the book 18.4.3 -> 


C)
The computational cost is greatly increased as the number of hash iterations increases


D) 
I would set the d on medium count and the delay to exponential count but starting slow 
to balance the actual delay from the has and the login delay


E)
The values of the variables might increase because in laptops the waiting time for login is naturally longer
