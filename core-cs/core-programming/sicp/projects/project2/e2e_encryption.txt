Understanding:
End-to-end encryption is a method to secure messages such that 
only the sender and the intended recipient can read them. 
Using C++ for encryption algorithms ensures better performance 
due to its low-level optimization capabilities. 
We will use cryptographic libraries to implement AES or RSA 
encryption/decryption and then integrate this with the Python backend to secure WebSocket messages.

Goal:
The goal is to implement secure end-to-end encryption for 
the chat messages exchanged between the frontend (React) and the backend (Python). 
The C++ component will handle encryption/decryption 
using cryptographic algorithms like AES, RSA, or Diffie-Hellman. 
The backend (Python) will call the C++ functions via pybind11, 
while the frontend will handle the encrypted messages and decrypt them when necessary.

Strategy:
1. Implement the encryption/decryption logic in C++.
2. Set up a Python-C++ interface using pybind11.
3. Modify the backend to call C++ encryption/decryption functions for any incoming or outgoing messages.
4. Ensure that the frontend can send and receive encrypted messages securely.
5. Perform testing and debugging to ensure that encryption is functioning properly.

Implementation:
1. C++ Implementation:
    - Use AES, RSA, or Diffie-Hellman for the encryption algorithm.
    - Libraries to use: OpenSSL or NaCl.
    - Example: Implement AES encryption for messages.

2. Python-C++ Interface:
    - Use pybind11 to expose the C++ encryption/decryption functions to Python.
    - The Python backend will call these C++ functions to encrypt messages 
    before sending and decrypt messages received from the frontend.

3. Frontend:
    - The frontend (React) will send encrypted messages to the backend.
    - The frontend will decrypt incoming messages using the same encryption method (AES or RSA).

Libraries:
1. OpenSSL: Used for cryptographic functions (AES, RSA, etc.)
2. NaCl: A simpler, high-level cryptographic library that offers secure encryption and decryption functions.
3. pybind11: To interface between C++ and Python.
4. React: To handle encrypted messages and send them over WebSocket.

Steps:
1. Set up OpenSSL or NaCl in your C++ project for encryption/decryption.
2. Use pybind11 to create bindings for your C++ code and expose functions to Python.
3. In the Python backend, integrate calls to these functions before sending messages to the frontend.
4. Test encryption/decryption on both frontend and backend.
