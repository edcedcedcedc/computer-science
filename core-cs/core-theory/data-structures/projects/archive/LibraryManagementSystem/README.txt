### **Library Management System (LMS)**

#### **1. Understanding**
The Library Management System (LMS) will manage a library's collection of books and users who borrow them. 
The system will allow for tracking books, adding new books, removing books, checking out books, returning books, and searching for books.

The primary goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with Java concepts such as classes, 
inheritance, data structures (like arrays, hashmaps, and linked lists), object-oriented design, and testing.

#### **2. Goal**
- Build a fully functional Library Management System.
- Use a combination of data structures like **arrays**, **linked lists**, and **hashmaps** to manage different components like books and users.
- Practice object-oriented programming principles (OOP) like **classes**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism**.
- Implement basic operations like **adding books**, **checking out books**, **searching**, **removing books**, and **viewing transactions**.
- Write tests for your system to ensure its functionality.

#### **3. Strategy**
The project will be divided into several smaller tasks. We will structure the project into key components:

1. **Books**
   - Each book will be represented by a class with attributes such as **title**, **author**, **ISBN**, **status** (available/checked out).
   
2. **Users**
   - Each user will be represented by a class with attributes like **name**, **user ID**, and a list of books they have checked out.

3. **Library**
   - The Library will store the collection of books. We will use **linked lists** here to represent a **dynamic collection of books** so that it can easily grow and shrink without needing to reallocate memory.
   
4. **Transactions**
   - Transactions will be stored to keep track of the history of check-outs and returns. This will also be done using **linked lists** to represent a **history of transactions** that maintains the order of events.

5. **Operations**
   - Implement operations such as:
     - **Add book**
     - **Remove book**
     - **Checkout book** (which will involve updating the status of a book)
     - **Return book** (again, updating the status)
     - **Search for books** by title, author, etc.
     - **View transaction history**

#### **4. Implementation**
- **Classes:**
  - **Book** class: Define the attributes for a book.
  - **User** class: Define the attributes for a user.
  - **Library** class: Maintain a collection of books, potentially using a **linked list** to allow flexible book management.
  - **Transaction** class: Represent individual transactions for borrowing and returning books. Use a **linked list** to track the sequence of transactions.
  
- **Data Structures:**
  - **Linked Lists**:
    - **Book Collection**: You can use a **linked list** for storing books in the library. Each **book node** would store information about the book (title, author, etc.) 
    and a reference to the next book in the list. This approach will allow you to add and remove books easily without worrying about fixed array sizes.
    - **Transaction History**: A **linked list** can be used to store the history of transactions, so you can keep a record of all checkouts and returns in order.
  - **HashMap**: For storing users and their checked-out books, use a **HashMap** with user ID as the key and the list of checked-out books as the value. This will make lookups fast.

- **Methods**:
  - **addBook(Book book)**: Adds a book to the library (use linked list).
  - **removeBook(Book book)**: Removes a book from the library (linked list).
  - **checkoutBook(Book book, User user)**: Checks out a book and updates both the book's status and the user's record.
  - **returnBook(Book book, User user)**: Returns a book and updates the book's status and the transaction history.
  - **searchBooks(String title)**: Searches for books by title and returns a list.
  - **viewTransactionHistory()**: Displays the list of all transactions (stored in a linked list).

#### **5. Evaluation**
- Write tests for the following:
  - Adding and removing books from the library.
  - Checking out and returning books.
  - Searching for books.
  - Viewing transaction history.
  - Handling edge cases such as attempting to check out a book that's already checked out, or returning a book that wasn’t checked out.

- Evaluate the system based on:
  - **Correctness**: Ensure all features are working as expected.
  - **Efficiency**: Evaluate the efficiency of operations, especially search and book addition/removal.
  - **Readability and maintainability**: Code should be well-organized and easy to understand.

#### **6. Additional Resources**
- Sierra & Bates, Java for Beginners (or equivalent textbooks)
- Goodrich & Tamassia, Data Structures and Algorithms (for concepts on linked lists and queues)

### **Linked List Usage**
- **In the Library class**, you’ll use a **linked list** to manage the books in the library. 
Each book will be represented as a node, with the node pointing to the next book in the collection.
  
- **In the Transaction class**, you’ll use a **linked list** to keep a 
chronological history of transactions (e.g., checkouts and returns),
 where each transaction is a node, pointing to the next transaction.
