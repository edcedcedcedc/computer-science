I am skipping this project it's too time consuming
and I am really lazy to understand all that,
I decided to go with the same concepts that I learnt in class
but just without overloading myself with extra-concepts, 
I am switching project1 to LibraryManagementSystem.
I also have a headache from a lot of math, open source projects,
gsoc 2025.


update:
Okay I changed my mind, I have to do project1, even if its hard.
