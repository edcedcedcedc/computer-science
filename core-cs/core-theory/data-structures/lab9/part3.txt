Part III:  (2 points)
---------------------
Formally prove that 0.01 n^2 - 1  is NOT in  O(n).

We need to show that, no matter how large we choose c and N, we will never
obtain the desired inequality.  We cannot prove this by picking a specific
value of c and N.  Instead, we must study how the two functions behave as
n approaches infinity.

Let T(n) = 0.01 n^2 - 1, and let f(n) = n.  Prove that

                    c f(n)
            lim     ------ = 0,
        n->infinity  T(n)

no matter how large we choose c to be.  You will need to scale both the
numerator and the denominator by a well-chosen multiplier to get the result.

Use this result to show that there are no values c, N such that T(n) <= c f(n)
for all n >= N.

----------- my solution 

Proove that 
T(n) = 0.01 * n^2 - 1 not in O(n) 
no constant c > 0 and N exists such that for all  n >= N the inequality is 0.01n^2 - 1 <= c * n 

state the given equations 
c * f(n) = c * n 
T(n) = 0.01n^2 - 1 

engineer and divide by n 
(c * n)/n  / (0.01n^2 - 1 )/n

take the limit 
lim as n -> infinity  of c / (0.01n - 1/n)
lim of 1/n -> 0
lim of 0.01n -> infinity 
lim of c / 0.01n -> 0 

conclusion 
as n -> infinity, c * f(n) / T(n) -> 0

therefore 
T(n) > c * f(n) for all large n 

there are no constants such that 
T(n) <= c * f(n) for all n >= N, T(n) not in O(n)
