claim 
2^n + 1 in O(4^n - 16)

I want to proove that there exists constants c > 0 and n0 > 1 such that 
2^n + 1 <= c(4^n - 16) for all  n >= n0 

try to find a value for c and value for n0 that the inequality holds
4^n = (2^2)^n = 2^2n

2^n + 1 <= c(2^2n - 16)

с----n------
1    1      2^1 + 1 = 3 <= -12 = 1(4 - 16)
2    2      2^2 + 1 = 5 <=  0  = 2(4^2 - 16)
3    3      2^3 + 1 = 9 <= 144 = 3(4^3 - 16) = 3(64 - 16)

thus 

2^n + 1 in O(4^n - 16)
