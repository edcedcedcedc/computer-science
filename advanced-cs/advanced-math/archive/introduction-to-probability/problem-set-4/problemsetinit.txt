This file contains simplified versions of both **Strategic Practice** and **Homework** problems, designed for easy understanding and practice.

## **Part 1 – Distributions and Expected Values**

### 1. Matching but never equal
Give an example of two random variables X and Y that have the same distribution but X = Y never happens.

### 2. Days of the week
Let X be a random day of the week (Monday = 1, …, Sunday = 7). Let Y be the next day.  
- Do X and Y have the same distribution?  
- What is P(X < Y)?

### 3. First head
Flip a coin repeatedly until it lands Heads. Let X be the number of flips.  
- If the coin is fair, what is P(X = 1), P(X = 2), P(X = 3)?  
- Sketch a simple graph of the CDF for X.

### 4. Expected value sum
Let X take values 1, 2, 3,… with probabilities P(X = n) = 1/2^n. Compute E(X).

### 5. Eggs and chicks (homework)
You have 3 eggs. Each hatches with probability 1/2, and each chick survives with probability 1/2.  
- How many chicks do you expect to hatch?  
- How many survive?

### 6. Stopping with a boy and girl (homework)
A family keeps having children until they have at least 1 boy and 1 girl. Probability of boy or girl is 1/2 each.  
- Expected number of children?

## **Part 2 – Indicator Variables & Linearity of Expectation**

### 1. Birthday pairs
In a group of 5 people, what is the expected number of pairs with the same birthday? (Assume 7 days in a week.)

### 2. Random bags
3 students each randomly get one candy bag from a total of 3 bags.  
- Expected number of bags the first two students get in total?  
- Expected number of students who get at least one bag?

### 3. Empty boxes
3 balls are placed randomly into 3 boxes. What is the expected number of empty boxes?

### 4. Hash table (homework)
3 people each randomly get a slot in a 3-slot hash table.  
- Expected number of empty slots?  
- Expected number of slots with exactly one person?

## **Part 3 – Simple Conditional / Combinatorial**

### 1. First better candidate
You interview 3 candidates C1, C2, C3 in random order. Let X be the index of the first candidate better than C1.  
- List all possibilities and find E(X).

### 2. Random balls in boxes (homework)
Randomly, 3 distinguishable balls are placed into 3 distinguishable boxes.  
- Find the expected number of empty boxes.

### 3. Fisher exact test (simplified)
Suppose 2 women and 2 men are tested for a disease. X = # of women with disease, Y = # of men with disease.  
- If total diseased = 2, what is the probability X = 1 given X + Y = 2?

---

## **Part 4 – Sorting / Inversions**

### 1. Inversions in a list
Consider the list [2,1,3]. How many inversions are there?  
- Expected number of inversions in all lists of 3 numbers?

### 2. Bubble sort sweeps (small)
Bubble sort [3,1,2]. How many comparisons are made?

### 3. Algorithm expected comparisons (homework)
Simplified: For 3 numbers in random order, what is the expected number of comparisons to sort with bubble sort?

---

## **Part 5 – Records / High Jumps**

### 1. Records
3 jumpers compete one at a time. A “record” means jumping higher than anyone before.  
- Probability that 2nd jumper sets a record?  
- Expected number of records among 3 jumpers?

---

## **Part 6 – CDF / Distribution**

### 1. Converting CDF
Let X be a r.v. with CDF F. Some countries use G(x) = P(X < x) instead.  
- Show how to convert F to G.

### 2. Chicks distribution
Number of chicks that hatch = Binomial(n=3, p=1/2).  
- Number that survive? Distribution?

### 3. Simple Monty Hall / coin style (homework)
Flip coin until heads. Distribution of number of flips? PMF? CDF?
