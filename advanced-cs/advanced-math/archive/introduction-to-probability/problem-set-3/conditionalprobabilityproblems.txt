problem 1(with help)

Bag 1 contains 4 red marbles and 6 blue marbles 
Bag 2 contains 3 red marbles and 7 blue marbles 

You choose a bag at random (each bag has 50% chance of being selected)

What is the probability that you draw a red marble ?
use the law of total probability to find P(Red)

1)define the events

B1 event that I choose bag 1, P(B1) = 0.5
B2 event that I choose bag 2, P(B2) = 0.5
R event that I draw a red marble

2)find the conditional probablities
(favourable/total, we can't use classic formula here)
P(R given B1) = 4/10
P(R given B2) = 3/10 


3)apply the law of total probability 
P(R) = P(R given B1) * B(1) + P(R given B2) * (B2)
