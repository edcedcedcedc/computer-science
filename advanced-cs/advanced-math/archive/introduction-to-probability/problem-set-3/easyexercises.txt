A set of easy exercises that cover all the concepts 
for problem set 3 to get me back into context 
and refresh (because I am a noob and cannot solve hard problems, this is Harvard)

## **Simple Practice Problems – Stat 110 Concepts**

### **1. Conditioning and Independence**

1. You roll a fair 6-sided die. Let $X = 1$ if the roll is even, 0 otherwise. Let $Y = 1$ if the roll is greater than 3, 0 otherwise.
   (a) Are $X$ and $Y$ independent?
   (b) Let $Z = 1$ if the roll is 6, 0 otherwise. Are $X$ and $Y$ independent **given $Z$**?

2. Let $X$ and $Y$ be independent fair coin flips. Let $Z = X \oplus Y$ (XOR).
   Compute $P(X=0, Y=0 \mid Z=0)$ and compare it to $P(X=0 \mid Z=0) P(Y=0 \mid Z=0)$. What does this tell you about conditional independence?

### **2. Monty Hall Simplified**

1. There are 3 doors. You pick Door 1. The car is equally likely behind any door. Monty always opens a door with a goat.
   (a) If you **always switch**, what is the probability of winning?
   (b) If Monty opens Door 2, what is the probability you win by switching?

### **3. Simpson’s Paradox**

1. In a small class:

   * Group A: 2 students, both fail.
   * Group B: 3 students, 2 fail.
     Compute $P(\text{fail} \mid A)$, $P(\text{fail} \mid B)$, and $P(\text{fail})$ overall. Could the overall probability be higher for Group A even if each subgroup is lower?

### **4. Gambler’s Ruin Simplified**

1. A gambler flips a fair coin. They start with \$0 and stop if they reach \$2 or \$-1.
   (a) Draw a simple tree for all possible outcomes.
   (b) What is the probability they reach \$2 before \$-1?

### **5. Bernoulli and Binomial**

1. Flip a fair coin 3 times. Let $X$ = number of heads.
   (a) List all outcomes.
   (b) Compute $P(X = 2)$.
   (c) If you flip another fair coin $Y$ once, independent of $X$, what is the distribution of $X + Y$?

2. Flip 2 coins. Conditional on exactly 1 head showing, list all possible sequences. Are they equally likely?

These problems are **very basic**, but they touch:

* Conditional probability & independence
* Monty Hall intuition
* Simpson’s paradox concept
* Simple gambler’s ruin tree
* Binomial/Bernoulli probability
